CODE REVIEW
EXERCISE 17
TEAM PENT ALPHA




Suggestions:


* Import statement format
Separate imports into lines for clarity
https://github.com/PUP-BSIT/exercise-15-pentalpha/blob/a59386e26d2a1861cfe219a26098fdbff336973a/main.py#L2


* Unnecessary Code in Try Block
Avoid putting non-error-prone code in try blocks. This is acceptable but could be better structured as:
if not menu_choice.isdigit():
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
    input("Press any key to continue...")
    continue
menu_choice = int(menu_choice)

Needs to Improve:


* Incorrect match Usage in change_mode()
        Issue: choice is an int, but cases are strings '1', '2', etc.

* Bad import style
As per in guideline: "Avoid multiple imports on the same line", "Put imports in separate lines"
https://github.com/PUP-BSIT/exercise-15-pentalpha/blob/a59386e26d2a1861cfe219a26098fdbff336973a/pentalpha/banzali.py#L2


* Undescriptive Variable
choice is acceptable, but better if it's more specific like menu_choice

* Magic Values in Accelerate


https://github.com/PUP-BSIT/exercise-15-pentalpha/blob/a59386e26d2a1861cfe219a26098fdbff336973a/pentalpha/banzali.py#L29


* Incorrect Method to Check .isalpha
Issue: new_nationality.isalpha is a function, not a function call.

* Missing Guard Clauses
In functions like change_name() or change_types(), a guard clause could help:
Instead of nesting, return early on failure. Your code already does this, so ✔ good job!


* No Constants for Menu Choices
You use magic numbers like 1, 2, 3... in process_choice().


* Minor Guideline Violations
Space after equals sign (in new_temp= float(new_temp)):
Issue: Add spaces in between operand, operator, and equals

* Random Elements Without Count
The number of elements is random, which is fine, but for clarity and consistency, you might:

* isalpha() May Reject Valid Input
